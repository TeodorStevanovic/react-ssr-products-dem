# React SSR Products Demo

This project is a simple learning example of **React Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.

The goal of this project is to understand how a React component can be rendered
on the server using Node.js and Express.

## What is this project about?

In this project:
- An Express server renders a React component on the server
- The server generates HTML using `renderToString`
- The browser receives already rendered HTML

This helps demonstrate the basic idea of **isomorphic JavaScript**.
